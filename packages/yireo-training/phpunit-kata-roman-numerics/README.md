# PHPUnit Kata - Roman Numerics
This package contains a kata to play around with Roman numerics. The goal is to create a class `RomanNumerics` that receives a decimal number (`42`) and converts it to a Roman number (`XLII`) - possibly using a `decimalToRoman()` method. Once completed, you can optionally also created the reverse method - `romanToDecimal()`.
        
For reference,  the following numbers are used:

- `I` = 1
- `V` = 5
- `X` = 10
- `L` = 50
- `C` = 100
- `D` = 500
- `M` = 1000
